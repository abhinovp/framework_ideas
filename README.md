ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abhinov a.k.a ippudkippude, I am interested in building automation solutions for business problems of any scale.
I started with Python back in 2016 and have been focusing of QA procedures driven by automated tools and frameworks. I am learning about GCP, BigQueryML, AutoML, ML APIs, sci-kit, pandas and tensorflow as part of understanding essence of data science/Artificial Intelligence which, I consider as a fuel( more to understand and enhance) to propel data science ideas into real time usable units.
